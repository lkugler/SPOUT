UPDATE (3/29/14): I have added in WRF netCDF file capabilities.  The interpolations and other portions of that code could use some parallelization.  Code will be improved steadily from here on, as I work through some of the other issues.

Please make sure to post and/or email me about improvements to the code.

More information and code will be posted here in the coming weeks and months as we continue to port the SPOUT code from IDL to Python.

The code is still relatively rudimentary (alpha-quality), but that's why we're having everyone here help out and build up something terrific and amazing for the Meteorological Modeling community to use!  Hopefully, it will be beta-quality in a couple months.

Thanks for your patience as we get this project going!
