SPOUT
=====

Statistical and Programmable Objective Updraft Tracker

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please check out the Wiki for more information.

More information and code will be posted here in the coming weeks and months as we port the SPOUT code from IDL to Python.

The code will be relatively rudimentary (alpha-quality), but that's why we're having everyone here help out and build up something terrific and amazing for the Meteorological Modeling community to use!

Thanks for your patience as we get this project going!
