SPOUT
=====

Statistical and Programmable Objective Updraft Tracker

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please check out the Wiki for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE (11/6/19): Thanks to some renewed interest in SPOUT, I will be adding in some new features.  Primary among them
will be automated CM1 and WRF read-in.  Secondary, and more important for other personal research, will be the ability to handle 
larger tracked datasets with better output formatting.  Tertiary will be a more region-based setup for fine-scale (sub-500m)
resolutions, since models now resolve convection on smaller scales where single point maxima may be inappropriate.

Code updates will occur in the next couple months after testing with CM1 and higher-resolution datasets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE (8/4/15): Sorry for the lack of updates recently.  I've been working on the second paper and some other
projects in the meanwhile.  I have plans on releasing an updated version of this in the coming months, especially
after some testing on severe weather model cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE (3/29/14): I have added in WRF netCDF file capabilities.  The interpolations and other portions of that code could use some parallelization.  Code will be improved steadily from here on, as I work through some of the other issues.

Please make sure to post and/or email me about improvements to the code.

More information and code will be posted here in the coming weeks and months as we continue to port the SPOUT code from IDL to Python.

The code is still relatively rudimentary (alpha-quality), but that's why we're having everyone here help out and build up something terrific and amazing for the Meteorological Modeling community to use!  Hopefully, it will be beta-quality in a couple months.

Thanks for your patience as we get this project going!
